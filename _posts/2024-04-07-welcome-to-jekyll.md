# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Jekyll. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that takes your content written in Markdown, processes it through a template engine, and creates a complete, static website ready to be served.

## Features

- Simple and fast
- Blog-aware permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts
- A template system that's easy to use
- Built-in support for code syntax highlighting
- Integrated with GitHub Pages

## Getting Started

To get started with Jekyll, you need to:

1. Install Ruby and Jekyll
2. Create a new Jekyll site
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Build and serve your site locally

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Jekyll!")
```
